When faced with different opinions, infiniwe should try to reach agreement by friendly discussion and reasonable agrument. I wholeheatedly agree with this view since different people tend to think differently and disagreement is inevitable. What matters most is learning how to resolve these disagreement so as to avoid unnecessary conflicts and desputes.
Firstly friendly discussion can create a good atomsphere for communication, making it easier for those who have different opinions to listen to other's views and respect other's feelings, so that they can better understand each other's point of view, and even find their common ground. Furthermore, when opinions differ, discussing contentious issues in friendly way does not mean that we have to completely give up our perspective or stand. When listening to other's opinions in open mind, we should dare to present arguments to support our thoughts.But do bear in mind that keeping calm and rational is crucial to persuade others.
In short, when encountering different opinions, we should communicate with others in a calm and friendly manner and try to explain our views as reasonable as posible, resolving the differens with honesty and frankness.

Today increasing importance is attached to college students' team spirit. There is no doubt that teamwork is indispensable for college students in life, study and even in their future work. Cultivating team spirit has become an important element of quarlity education for college students.
In my opinion, the improtance of team spirit is mainly based on the following two aspects. For one thing, team spirit has positive significance for college students. Learning to help each other and coorporate with one anther cannot only cultivate sincere relationship among students, but make them find that the power of teamwork is infinite. For another, from today's recruitment advertisements, we can easily find that more and more companies are taking 'good team spirit' as important criterion to hire employees. Compared those who only focus on themselves, college students graduate with good team spirit will be more competive and welcome when entering the workplace.
Team spirit is both power and wealth. As college students, we must place more value on our team spirit and contribute  to building a better and hormonious society.
